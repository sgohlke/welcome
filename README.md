# Projects and Repositories

## graphql-server
As I had problems using ApolloServer and ApolloGateway we decided on project level to provide an own implementation of a GraphQLServer/middleware. This is available in the [@dreamit/graphql-server](https://github.com/dreamit-de/graphql-server) project and has been published to [npm-registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dreamit/graphql-server).

## ts-base-dependencies
When updating dependencies using Dependabot on my Github projects I experienced how long it takes to keep multiple projects up to date when every devDependencies has to be updated one by one. So I created this project to group often used devDependencies together to ease updating them. This is available in the [@sgohlke/ts-base-dependencies](https://github.com/sgohlke/ts-base-dependencies) project and has been published to [npm-registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sgohlke/ts-base-dependencies).

## Deno projects
I love to play around and use Deno as Typescript/Javascript runtime. You can find some examples on how to use Deno, how to reference a ts file on github as dependency and how to deploy a service to Deno Deploy. There is also one NodeJS Project to demonstrate the differences between a Deno and NodeJS project. 
Interested now? See my [Deno projects list](https://github.com/stars/sgohlke/lists/deno-projects).

## rpg-ts (on hold)
One of my hobby projects to provide some game logic for a RPG (role play game) library to play a simple battle between two units. This is still in an early stage and not ready for excessive use, just a fun project for me to code around. You can find the project [here](https://github.com/sgohlke/rpg-ts). At the moment the project is on hold due to many other projects.

##  Playground projects 
Playground projects are marked with tag **playground-project** and are just try outs that won't recieve regular dependency updates. See my [Playground projects list](https://github.com/stars/sgohlke/lists/playground-projects).
