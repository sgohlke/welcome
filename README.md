# Welcome to my Github repositories

You can find some nice projects and examples in my repositories. 

## graphql-server
As I had problems using ApolloServer and ApolloGateway we decided on project level to provide an own implementation of a GraphQLServer/middleware. This is available in the [@dreamit/graphql-server project](https://github.com/dreamit-de/graphql-server) project and has been publised to [npm-registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dreamit/graphql-server).

## Deno projects
I love to play around and use Deno as Typescript/Javascript runtime. You can find some examples on how to use Deno, how to reference a ts file on github as dependency and how to deploy a service to Deno Deploy. There is also one NodeJS Project to demonstrate the differences between a Deno and NodeJS project. 
Interested now? See my [Deno projects list](https://github.com/stars/sgohlke/lists/deno-projects).

## npm-audit-wrapper
I wrote this as a short script to exclude some dependencies from npm audit checks and run npm audit without them. Also this can use a custom registry for npm audit calls in case you use a private registry that is not configured to allow npm audit. This is just as PoC and has not yet tested and/or release as library. You can find the project [here](https://github.com/sgohlke/npm-audit-wrapper).

## rpg-ts
One of my hobby projects to provide some game logic for a RPG (role play game) library to play a simple battle between two units. This is still in an early stage and not ready for excessive use, just a fun project for me to code around. You can find the project [here](https://github.com/sgohlke/rpg-ts).

##  Playground projects 
Playground projects are marked with tag **playground-project** and are just try outs that won't recieve regular dependency updates. See my [Playground projects list](https://github.com/stars/sgohlke/lists/playground-projects).
